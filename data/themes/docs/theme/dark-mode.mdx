# Dark mode

<Description>Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.</Description>

## Overview

Dark mode has gained widespread popularity in recent years, with operating systems now offering first-class support.

Out of the box, Radix Themes comes with built-in light and dark modes, allowing you to effortlessly switch appearance without any additional design or styling.

<Box my="5">
  <ThemesDarkModeExample />
</Box>

## Basic usage

By default, the root `Theme` appearance will be `light`. To set a different appearance simply pass the `appearance` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.

```jsx line=1
<Theme __appearance__="dark">
  <MyApp />
</Theme>
```

## System preference and persistence

A common requirement is to inherit the appearance setting from a users system preferences.

This is a deceptively complex problem to solve given SSR, SSG and client side hydration considerations. To avoid these pitfalls and make implementation easier, we recommend integrating with a theme persistence library such as [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

### With next-themes

Integrating with `next-themes` is simple and straight-forward, and allows you to avoid common pitfalls with client hydration that can create unsightly flashing during initial render.

Here's an example showing usage and configuration at the root of your application.

```jsx line=6
import { Theme } from '@radix-ui/themes';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes';

export default function () {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider
      __attribute__="class"
      __value__={{ light: 'light-theme', dark: 'dark-theme' }}
      disableTransitionOnChange
      defaultTheme="system"
    >
      <Theme>
        <MyApp />
      </Theme>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

{

<Callout.Root my="5">
  <Callout.Icon>
    <InfoCircledIcon />
  </Callout.Icon>
  <Callout.Text>
    It's important to specify the <Code>attribute</Code> and <Code>value</Code>{' '}
    configuration and <Strong>not</Strong> to pass <Code>appearance</Code>.
  </Callout.Text>
</Callout.Root>

}

Note that we do not pass the `appearance` prop to `Theme`. We instead tell `next-themes` to apply a specific `class` to the `html` when toggling themes. This is an important detail as `next-themes` will handle render blocking internally when using this approach, avoiding any unsightly flashing during initial render.

Radix Themes supports the following classes for mapping themes to the appearance:

- `light`
- `dark`
- `light-theme`
- `dark-theme`
