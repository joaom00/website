# Layout

<Description>Declarative layout and common spacing props.</Description>

## Composing layout

### Margins

### Padding

## Spacing scale

The spacing scale is used to apply space between elements. Values are derived from a 9 step scale.

### Layout scaling

Values which affect layout (spacing, typographic sizing, line heights) scale relatively based on the `scaling` value defined in your [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme). This setting allows you to scale the UI density uniformly across your entire application.
