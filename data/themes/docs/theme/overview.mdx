## Anatomy

A theme is comprised of a set of variables that define the appearance of your UI. Not only are these variables consumed directly by components, but they are also codified and exposed via tokens for use in your own custom elements.

Radix Themes provides a sensible default with reasonable values to get you started, but donâ€™t be afraid to play with the settings to find the right visual style for your application.

The look and feel of a theme is defined primarily by 7 core settings:

- **Accent scale** is the dominant color scale, used for primary buttons and other interactive elements.

- **Gray scale** is the neutral color scale, used for backgrounds, borders, text and non-interactive elements.

- **Text color** is the tonal color of text, this is either an entirely neutral gray or a tone derived from the accent scale.

- **Background color** is the themes background color, typically the background color of the app.

- **Appearance** is the light or dark scheme applied to components, this is typically referred to as light or dark mode.

- **Radius** is the border radius applied to components, larger values create a more playful feel within the UI.

- **Scaling** is a multiplier to modify the space between elements and related typographic sizes. Lower values are useful for data dense UIs.
