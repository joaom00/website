## Color scales

[Radix Colors](/colors/docs/palette-composition/scales) provides the foundation for the color system. Out of the box this provides 28, 12 step color scales, each with it’s own light, dark and alpha variants.

Colors are grouped into 2 categories: accents and grays, and can be specified either globally on your [Theme](/colors/docs/components/theme), or per component where applicable.

### Accents

Accents are the most dominant color in your theme, they are used for primary buttons, links and other interactive elements. The accent can be one of [23 scales](/themes/docs/theme/color#choosing-an-accent-scale).

<ThemesColorScale type="accent" />

### Grays

Grays are used for backgrounds, borders, text and other non-interactive elements. You can choose from one of [6 scales](/themes/docs/theme/color#choosing-a-gray-scale).

<ThemesColorScale type="gray" />

### Alpha variants

Every scale has an alpha variant which are designed to appear visually the same as their opaque counterparts when placed over a matching background. This is very powerful and allows colors to be overlayed without a loss of saturation or hue.

Alpha variants are used automatically within components so no configuration is required, however, if you’d like to use them manually in your own styles you can do so by using [Tokens](/colors/docs/theme/token-reference).

## Choosing an accent scale

There are 23 accents to choose from.

15 scales designed for light foreground text.

<ThemesAccentSwatches />

5 scales designed for dark foreground text.

<ThemesBrightAccentSwatches />

## Choosing a gray scale

There are 6 grays to choose from.

<ThemeGraySwatches />

- `Gray` is pure gray.
- `Mauve` is based on a desaturated purple hue.
- `Slate` is based on a desaturated blue hue.
- `Sage` is based on a desaturated green hue.
- `Olive` is based on a desaturated lime hue.
- `Sand` is based on a desaturated yellow hue.

### Neutral and natural pairing

By default, the theme will pair your chosen accent with a gray that is [designed to compliment it](/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#natural-pairing). If you’d prefer a more neutral vibe, or would otherwise like a different feel you can specify an alternative.

## Text color

Depending on the vibe you want, you can set your text color to match either your gray or accent scale with the `textColor` prop on your [Theme](/themes/docs/components/theme).

Using the `accent` setting will result in a richer, more colorful feel.

{

<Box my="5">
  <Theme
    textColor="accent"
    style={{ maxWidth: 550 }}
    className="radix-themes-example"
  >
    <Card size="3">
      <Heading mb="1" trim="start">
        Glossary
      </Heading>
      <Text as="p" trim="end">
        Taxonomy and language sorrounding products can be difficult to follow,
        refresh your memory with our glossary.
      </Text>
    </Card>
  </Theme>
</Box>

}

Using the `auto` (gray) setting will result in a more functional feel.

{

<Box my="5">
  <Theme
    textColor="auto"
    style={{ maxWidth: 550 }}
    className="radix-themes-example"
  >
    <Card size="3">
      <Heading mb="1" trim="start">
        Glossary
      </Heading>
      <Text as="p" trim="end">
        Taxonomy and language sorrounding products can be difficult to follow,
        refresh your memory with our glossary.
      </Text>
    </Card>
  </Theme>
</Box>

}

The difference may seem subtle, but it can make a huge difference with a full page of text or a densely populated UI.

You may want to experiment with these settings in your applications and websites to find what works for you.

## Semantic colors

In most apps, you will need to assign colors to communicate semantic meaning, for these cases we recommend using the `color` prop on the nessesary component/s to override the accent color.

Here are some common choices that work well in Western culture.

- **Error**: Red/Tomato/Crimson
- **Success**: Teal/Green/Grass/Mint
- **Warning**: Yellow/Amber
- **Info**: Blue/Sky/Cyan

## Using color tokens

All color values are available as CSS [tokens](/colors/docs/theme/token-reference) should you need them to build your own components, or simply wish to access the theme in your own styles.

See the [Token Reference](/colors/docs/theme/token-reference) for a full list of available values.
